               cd <repo-name>  
               git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>  
  
  - If you already have the repo forked, update your repo before working!!
  
                   git remote update
                  git checkout <branch-name> git rebase upstream/<branch-name
